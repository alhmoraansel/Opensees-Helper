## Usage
This project was created as a need for easier modelling and analysis using opensees.
The commands are easier to understand and interpret.
You can use pylance with vscode to get the sweet autocomplete working, 

#Tip: enable autocomplete brackets in pylance

Requirements:

pip install openseespy

pip install opsvis

pip install vfo

#NOTE
python 3.8 required, openseespy as of current, does not works well with the latest python version.
